## Reporting a Vulnerability

The maintainers of *wordrow* take security bugs very seriously. We appreciate
your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings. Due to the non-funded
open-source nature of this project, we take a best-efforts approach when it
comes to engaging with (security) reports.

To report a security issue, send an email to [security@ericcornelissen.dev] and
include the words _"SECURITY"_ and _"wordrow"_ in the subject line. Please do
not open a regular issue or Pull Request in the public repository.

## Scope

The following are **not** in scope:

- File paths provided as taint input: *wordrow* is meant to be run in a local
  environment.
- Docker-related issues: Docker is only used for development.

If you are unsure, send a report anyway.
